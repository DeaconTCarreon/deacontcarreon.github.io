Abstract:

What is antimatter? It has always been an interesting substance in the universe, especially because of its lack of presence in it. Despite being mathematically plausible, Our universe has come to be dominated by regular matter instead. But why is this? In the first UG Seminar of Spring 2025, we will take a look at antimatter's unique properties, why it's all gone, and how it was predicted then discovered. Then we will see the challenges with attempting to create our own, and some of the applications for this substance we will see unfold in the future.
