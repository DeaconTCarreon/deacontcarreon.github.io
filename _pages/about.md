Greetings! My name is Deacon Carreon, and I am a Physics & Astrophysics double major at UC Berkeley. I am currently doing research at the Space Sciences Laboratory that analyzes data on the radioactive noise of an onsite Americium-241 source collected by a detector. I also am currently a research & blogs writer for the Berkeley Scientific Journal, where I have currently written two blogs on Planetary Defense; one against asteroids, and the other against our own artificial satellites. I am also an MPS mentor, working to pass down the knowledge that I have acquired as an undergrad to others so they can succeed at what they do. My current goal after undergrad is to enter an Astrophysics Ph.D. program, and possibly join NASA or academia after that. In my free time, I like to read sci-fi and science books, play the piano, watch movies, and travel through cities and nature alike.
